## [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)

Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. It brokers data between programs using a publish-subscribe mechanism. 

### Nomenclature

Cluster -> a group of Kafka nodes/instances/servers lead by a Zookeeper instance  
Broker -> a Kafka deamon in charge of a node  
Node -> a "database" for topic partitions  
Topic -> a category/feed to which records are published  
Partition -> a partitioned log owned by a topic  
Replica -> a copy of the cluster leader node  
Consumer -> an application, a program which reads data to a topic  
Producer -> an application, a program which publishes data to a topic  
Stream -> an application, a program which reads data, transforms data and publishes the same to another topic  

### [Introduction](http://kafka.apache.org/intro)

Kafka is run as a cluster; stores streams of "records" in categories called "topics".

Producer: publish records to topics.  
Consumer: subscribe to topics and process streams of records.  
Streams: application as a stream processor; take the input stream from a topic and transform it into an output stream which outputs to a topic.  
Connector: connect topics to existing systems.  

Topic: category/feed to which records are published; has a partitioned log.  
Each partition in a log is ordered and immutable sequence of records. Partitions may be scattered over many nodes. Each record has an offset. The Kafka cluster controls when to delete the records using a retention policy.  

### [Quickstart](http://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)

#### Step 1

Java needs to be installed and configured.

First, download and install Kafka using a binary.
```
$: tar -xzf kafka_x.x-x.x.x.tgz
```

#### Step 2

To start Kafka, first start Zookeeper:  
```
$: bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties -> start Zookeeper
$: bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties -> start Kafka
```

#### Step 3

Topics are constructs that abstract data in Kafka.  
```
$: bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181 -> list topics
[script_name] [command] [invoke_zookeeper] [host:port_of_broker]
$: bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test_topic -> create topic
[script_name] [command] [invoke_zookeeper] [host:port_of_broker] [replication] [partitioning] [topic_name]
```

#### Step 4

Producers are constructs that send data to a Kafka topic.
```
$: bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test_topic -> command line producer
[script_name] [command] TODO
```

#### Step 5

Consumers are constructs that read data from a Kafka topic.
```
$: bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test_topic --from-beginning -> command line consumer
[script_name] [command] [bootstrap_server_to_connect] [topic_name] [begin_reading_from/offset]
```

#### Step 6

Kafka cluster can be made of only one node.  
To create a multi broker/node cluster start multiple Kafka instances.  

All Kafka instances must have different broker IDs and ports:  
```
$: cp config/server.properties config/server-1.properties
$: nano config/server-1.properties -> change "broker.id", "listeners", "log.dirs"

$: cp config/server.properties config/server-2.properties
$: nano config/server-2.properties -> change "broker.id", "listeners", "log.dirs"
```

Run Zookeeper and three Kafka brokers/nodes:  
```
$: bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties &
$: bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties &
$: bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server-1.properties &
$: bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server-2.properties &

$: ps -> PIDs
$: kill PID -> close program
```

Create a topic in a cluster:
```
$: bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 3 --partitions 1 --topic replicated_test -> create replicated topic
$: bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 3 --topic partitioned_test -> create partitioned topic
```

Inspect the topics:  
```
$: bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic replicated_test
  -> Topic:my-replicated-topic   PartitionCount:1    ReplicationFactor:3 Configs:
      -> Topic: replicated_test  Partition: 0    Leader: _leader_number   Replicas: 1,2,0 Isr: 1,2,0

$: bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic partitioned_test
  -> -
    -> -
```

You can try and kill the leader and then inspect the topics again to see what happened.  
```
$: ps -> PIDs
$: ps aux | grep server-_leader_number.properties -> find the _leader_number by inspecting the topic  
$: kill PID -> close program
```

#### Step 7

Use Kafka Connect instead of custome integration code.  
Kafka Connect is a construct that imports and exports data to and from Kafka.  

Start Connect in standalone mode, a local dedicated process:  
```
$: bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/connect-file-source.properties config/connect-file-sink.properties -> file reader/writer Connector pair  
[script_name] [connect_config] [connector_one_config] [connector_two_config]
```
Configuration files define the Connector's behaviour.  
The first Connector is a "source" and the second Connector is a "sink".  

The Connectors will continuously process data as you append data to the file.  

#### Step 8

Kafka Streams is a client library for building real time projects.  
It combines Java/Scala client side deployment and Kafka's server side cluster technology.  

### [Kafka in Production](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#operations) 

#### [Kafka Operations](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops)

Adding, removing, modifying topics.  
Graceful shutdown.  
Balancing leadership.  
Balancing replicas.  
Data mirroring between clusters.  
Checking consumer positions.  
Managing consumer groups.  
Cluster expansion.  
Automatic data migration.  
Decommissioning brokers.  
Increasing replicas factor.  
Setting quotas.

#### [Kafka Configuration](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#config)

Kafka has a lot of different [configuration settings](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#configuration).  

See a sample production server configuration.
